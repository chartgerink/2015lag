\section*{Journal model results}
When the results are specified per journal, model estimates are similar to the aggregate results describe previously. Most journal specific models included no meaningful effect for number of authors, number of pages, or presence of competing interests on either the review- or production time. Only for PLoS Clinical Trials and PLoS Biology the presence of competing interests had a noteworthy effect on review- and production time respectively ($b=.112$ and $b=.106$). This indicates that competing interests increase review- and production time by a factor of approximately 1.1 for Clinical Trials and PLoS Biology, respectively. All individual coefficients per journal for both review- and production time are available in S2 File. Figure 2 plots the mean estimated review- and production times for each journal.
