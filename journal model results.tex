\section*{Journal model results}
When specified per journal, highly similar results are found. With regards to model estimates, the only noteworthy difference is that, in the case of PLoS Biology, competing interests increase production time ($b=.11$). All other model estimates remain negligible and are available in S1 File.

Estimated mean review time differs for journals across years, whereas estimated mean production time is stable across years for all journals. Figure XX visually depicts these estimates. 

These models specified per journal give highly comparable results, except for one estimate in one journal. PLoS Biology only competing interests (.111)
