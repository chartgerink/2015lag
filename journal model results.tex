\section*{Journal model results}
When the results are specified per journal, model estimates are similar. Most journal specific models included no meaningful effect for number of authors, number of pages, or presence of competing interests on either the review- or production time. Only for PLoS Biology the presence of competing interests had a noteworthy effect on production time ($b=.11$), but this results . Figure 2 plots the mean estimated review- and production times for each journal.
