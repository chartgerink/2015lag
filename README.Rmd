```{r}
setwd("D:/Dropbox/projects/2015lag")

library(ggplot2)

load('archive/submitted_accepted')

qplot(submitted_accepted)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
