There is substantial variability in estimated mean review times across journals, but all journals show an increasing time taken to complete the review process. In accordance with the descriptive statistics given earlier, PLoS Medicine is the journal with the longest estimated mean review time, whereas PLoS ONE is the fastest. As of 2015, the review process takes between 150-250 days on average and is less variable than in the preceding years.

The estimated mean production times are highly consistent across journals, but deviate substantially from the aggregate results. Whereas the aggregate results show a curvilinear trend, with an initial decrease in production time and a subsequent inrease, the journal specific results show a stable mean estimate of 50 days. This indicates that aggregate 

These models specified per journal give highly comparable results, except for one estimate in one journal. PLoS Biology only competing interests (.111)
