Substantial variability is observed in estimated mean review times across journals, but all journals show an increasing time taken to complete the review process. In accordance with the descriptive statistics given earlier, PLoS Medicine has the longest estimated mean review time, whereas PLoS ONE is the fastest. As of 2015, the review process takes between 150-250 days on average and is less variable across journals than in the preceding years.

The estimated mean production times are highly consistent across journals and show less fluctuation than the aggregate results. The estimated mean review time is approximately 50 days across journals, across years.
